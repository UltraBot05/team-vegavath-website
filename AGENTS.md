# Vegavath Website — Agent Instructions

This file is read by AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, etc).
Follow these rules exactly. Do not improvise structure.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Framer Motion (UI transitions only)
- React Three Fiber + Drei (3D kart model)
- Neon (Postgres) via @neondatabase/serverless
- Cloudflare R2 via @aws-sdk/client-s3
- NextAuth.js v5 (admin auth)

## Folder Structure — Do Not Deviate

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### ALWAYS

- TypeScript strict mode. Every prop typed. No implicit any.
- Server Components fetch data. Client Components handle interactivity only.
- All images use next/image with R2 URLs. Never `<img>` tags.
- All DB logic goes in src/lib/services/. API routes call service functions.
- All list queries use LIMIT. Gallery default 30, events default 20.
- Error boundaries on every async server component.
- Skeleton loading states for all DB-fetched sections.
- Mobile-first CSS — 375px first, scale up.
- ISR (revalidate: 60) for public pages except /join and /events/[slug].
- SSR only for /join, /events/[slug], and all /admin/* routes.

### NEVER

- ignoreBuildErrors or ignoreDuringBuilds in next.config.ts
- Binary files (images, videos) committed to git
- Plaintext passwords or secrets in code or commits
- Raw SQL in API routes — use services/ layer
- Admin API routes without session verification
- force-dynamic on root layout
- Unbounded SELECT queries without LIMIT
- Duplicate business logic between public and admin routes
- `<img>` tags — always next/image
- Inline styles — always Tailwind classes

## Build Order (do not skip steps)

1. DB schema + indexes (src/lib/db.ts + migrations/)
2. Services layer (src/lib/services/)
3. API routes (src/app/api/)
4. Auth + middleware (src/lib/auth.ts + src/middleware.ts)
5. UI components and pages (last)

## Rendering Strategy

- ISR revalidate:60 → /, /about, /events, /gallery, /crew, /sponsors
- ISR revalidate:120 → static-heavy pages
- SSR (no cache) → /join, /events/[slug], /admin/*
- Static → 404, error pages

## Services Layer Contract

API routes and pages NEVER write SQL directly.
They call functions from src/lib/services/*.ts only.
If two routes need the same data, they call the same service function.
