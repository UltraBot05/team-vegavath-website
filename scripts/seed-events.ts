    description: `## Ignition 1.0

An 18-hour IoT overnight hackathon hosted by Team Vegavath in partnership with **Ather Energy**.

Teams of up to 4 members designed and demonstrated a wearable telemetry system mountable on a rider's gear — capturing and visualising movement and ride data in real time using hardware sensors paired with a mobile or web application.

### Prize Pool
- 1st Prize: ₹16,000
- 2nd Prize: ₹12,000
- Innovation Challenge: ₹7,000

### Event Details
- **Duration:** 18 hours overnight
- **Venue:** PES University, Electronic City Campus
- **Open to:** All engineering students across EC and RR campuses

### What Teams Built
Prototypes combining motion sensing (accelerometer, gyroscope, IMU), GPS tracking, wireless data transfer (BLE/Wi-Fi), and live mobile or web dashboards — all mounted on actual riding gear provided at the event.

Winners received cash prizes, certificates, and an opportunity to intern at Ather Energy.`,
